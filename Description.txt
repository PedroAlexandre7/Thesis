!!Main Description: This project in industry-academia collaboration between iscte and KPMG details the development of a spreadsheet-based framework for dimensioning private IoT networks, targeting smart city coverage analysis. This proposed template uses formula-based estimations (e.g., for throughput) and explores macro automation for its workflow. It adopts an assumption-driven approach, aiming to demonstrate a streamlined methodology for initial network sizing and planning. I had supervision from KPMG with it's main advisor being Tomás Santos, and second advisor Rúben Silva. My advisor at iscte was João Silva
