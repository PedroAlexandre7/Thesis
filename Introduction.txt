CHAPTER 1
Introduction
Context and objective
This thesis introduces the development of a sizing model for public IoT networks, explicitly designed to support smart city coverage planning. As urban environments increasingly rely on connected sensors, meters, and actuators, ensuring reliable and scalable communication infrastructure becomes critical for municipalities and public authorities. The proposed model addresses this challenge by providing a structured, assumption-driven approach for initial network dimensioning, enabling planners to generate rapid, transparent, and defensible estimates of coverage, capacity, and resource requirements. By focusing on public IoT deployments within smart-city contexts, this work bridges the gap between conceptual planning and actionable design, offering a practical methodology for early-stage decision-making.
Conventional network design toolchains tend to be either (i) sophisticated but closed and time-consuming to configure, or (ii) ad hoc spreadsheets whose logic is difficult to audit or reuse. Public authorities and project teams often face a gap at the outset: they need a structured, assumption-driven sizing method that is lightweight enough for rapid iteration, yet rigorous enough to reveal key drivers and trade-offs. This gap is especially critical in public IoT deployments—such as city-wide, district, or municipal networks—where technology choices (e.g., LPWAN versus cellular), propagation conditions, device density, and duty cycle constraints interact in complex and often unpredictable ways.

This project, conducted within an industry–academia collaboration between ISCTE and KPMG, details the development of a spreadsheet‑based framework for dimensioning public IoT networks, with a focus on smart‑city coverage analysis. The proposed template uses formula‑based estimations (e.g., for throughput) and explores macro automation for its workflow. It adopts an assumption‑driven approach, aiming to demonstrate a streamlined methodology for initial network sizing and planning. The work benefited from supervision by KPMG—primary advisor Tomás Santos and secondary advisor Rúben Silva—and academic supervision at ISCTE by João Silva.
The primary objective of this work is to develop and validate a reusable, spreadsheet-based template that facilitates the initial planning of public IoT networks for smart-city-like scenarios. Specifically, the project aims to: (1) define the minimum inputs and assumptions a planner needs to provide; (2) develop formula‑based estimates for link budget, throughput, message success rate, and site density; (3) organize the workbook so that dependencies are clear and easy to verify; and (4) investigate macro‑level automation (VBA) to handle common tasks—such as scenario setup, toggling assumptions, and generating standardized reports and charts.
This objective leads to the following research questions:
(RQ1) What are the essential parameters required to develop a practical dimensioning template for public IoT networks?
(RQ2?) How does a heavily assumption‑driven modeling approach impact the feasibility and utility of the dimensioning tool for initial network planning?
(RQ3) What are the primary practical challenges and limitations encountered when attempting to automate network‑analysis processes within a spreadsheet environment? 
(RQ4) How can the complex process of public IoT network dimensioning be effectively simplified and modeled into a reusable template for rapid, first‑pass coverage analysis?
Scope
The template targets the "first‑pass" stage of planning. Where clarity and speed are preferable over exhaustive fidelity. The modeling approach is explicitly assumption‑driven: users declare traffic models (e.g., payload sizes, periodicity), radio conditions (e.g., path‑loss model, noise signal) and sector devices. The outputs are screening‑level estimates of coverage, capacity, and site counts suitable for comparing alternatives and prioritizing further study. The template does not seek to replace detailed propagation simulation, war‑driving, or RF optimization.
Methodology 
the work proceeds by (i) requirements elicitation with practitioners; (ii) definition of a canonical, technology‑agnostic structure for the workbook; (iii) decision of compact formulas for key estimations; and (iv) implementation in Microsoft Excel using cell formulas for traceability and VBA for workflow automation. Particular attention is paid to separating input assumptions from computed layers, tagging each dependency, and enabling scenario replication with minimal manual steps.


Contributions
The contributions of this project are threefold. First, it proposes a minimal yet complete set of parameters and structural components for a practical IoT dimensioning template, organizing inputs, calculations, and reporting so that the logic remains auditable. Second, it codifies a set of formula‑based estimations for the early sizing of public networks and shows how these can be combined to obtain coverage and capacity screens under explicit service targets. Third, it assesses the benefits and pain points of spreadsheet automation for network analysis—documenting where VBA macros streamline repetitive tasks and where the language and host environment impose limitations, maintenance overhead, or brittleness.
An assumption‑driven model is both a strength and a limitation. It forces transparency about what is known versus what is asserted, enabling stakeholders to test sensitivity to radio margins, traffic distributions, or retry policies. At the same time, simplifying assumptions—such as homogeneous propagation classes, stationary traffic, or ideal scheduling—can overstate feasibility if taken too far. The template therefore emphasizes scenario tagging, parameter ranges, and "sanity‑check" dashboards to reveal when estimates fall outside plausible envelopes. (Research this last phrase)
The project also documents the practicalities of automating a dimensioning workflow in a spreadsheet. Where appropriate, macros help (re)initialize scenarios, validate inputs, calculate batches, and render standardized charts and summaries. However, experience shows that non‑trivial automation in VBA is labor‑intensive, fragile under workbook evolution, and limited in language ergonomics and testing support. These findings inform recommendations on what to automate in‑sheet versus what to keep as explicit, auditable formulas, and delineate pathways for migrating to more robust tooling when teams outgrow the template.
From an industrial perspective, the template aims to shorten the time from idea to first‑order network plan, allowing consultants and municipal teams to triage options and focus detailed engineering where it matters most. By constraining the problem to declared assumptions and well‑scoped estimations, organizations can create repeatable analyses across districts or use cases and build a library of comparable scenarios.
